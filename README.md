# YouTube-Crawling

## test.py
Run the test.py file in your terminal.

## Attention
The test.py file, the YouTube_project.py file and the company youtube link.csv file should be in the same folder.

The program will automatically create the folder for different companies and the issue folder if there's any issue when crawling.
